# JSBootcamp

Get up and running with basic JS. No theory only practical

The master branch contains code in Vanilla JS (Plain JS).

The react branch contains a simple page written in react.


The app has only 2 routes as of now --
* `/` -  default route
* `/products/nike` - returns a list of products from **nike**

## To run the app - 
* `git clone` the repo
* `npm i`
* start the node server - `npm start`
